** The word in style tag before the css code is presented is known as CSS Selector.
    eg:- <style>
            button{}
         </style>
** CSS Selector describes which elements we need to style.
** In CSS, space present inside a button is called padding.
    eg:- padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;padding-left/right:15px;
** In order to make text bold we use:
    eg:- font-weight:bold;
** In order to make the button corners curve than edge shaped use,
    eg:- border-radius:10px; // the more you increase the pixels the large and good it looks.
** In order to make the cursor a pointer in the form of hand then use,
    eg:- cursor:pointer;
