** The word in style tag before the css code is presented is known as CSS Selector.
    eg:- <style>
            button{}
         </style>
** CSS Selector describes which elements we need to style.
** In CSS, space present inside a button is called padding.
    eg:- padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;padding-left/right:15px;
** In order to make text bold we use:
    eg:- font-weight:bold;
** In order to make the button corners curve than edge shaped use,
    eg:- border-radius:10px; // the more you increase the pixels the large and good it looks.
** In order to make the cursor a pointer in the form of hand then use,
    eg:- cursor:pointer;
** .classList is used to give us the control of the class attribute. It is also an object
    which does contains methods.
** Space on the inside of an element is padding and -->> space on the outside of element is called 
    "Margin".git
** If we seperate the css file from html file then we use link tag which is void element that doesnt have
    ending tag and we need to put <link rel="stylesheet" href="address">
** In order to create a grid and make a proper format to perform it then, use display
    eg:- grid-template-columns:200px 150px 100px; then it is used to give proper spacing in between 
    columns of bars in grid format between them.
** We can even add an extra css class to the exisiting style through the comma[,].
** While using grid specification in order to obtain column or row gap then we need to use 
    eg:- column-gap:10px; row-gap:10px;
** In css, of the grid part incase if there is alignment issues between grid then use,
    eg:- align-items:center/strecth;
