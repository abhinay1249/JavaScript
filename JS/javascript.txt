Falsy Values --->> false, 0, '', NaN, undefined, null

Functions ---->> a block of code that can be reused again and again.

   ** Rules for function names ---> no reserved keywords, cannot start with number, no special characters.
   ** Variables created in the block have no global scope.
   ** Return does gets a value out of a function.
   ** Parameter does puts a value into a function.

Objects ---->> An object groups multiple values together.

   ** It can be created using {} and inside the braces it contains name:'abhinay'
      where in name is the property and abhinay is the value assigned.
   ** A dot notation is something which is used to access the value.
   ** If the dot notation is notExist then it displays undefined.
   ** We can add new property or even delete an existing property from the object.
      eg:- product.name = 'cotton socks';
           delete product.name;
   ** Why objects? Instead of declaring multiple variables we can group multiple values
      together in the form of objects.
   ** Bracket Notation = Object values can be retrieved by using the square brackets.
      eg:- products['name']; It does let us use properties that dont work with dot notation.
   ** console.log() -->> here, console is the object and log is the function so does js deals with objects
      and methods.
   ** Built in objects ---->> two types
      a. json(javascript object notation)
      b. local storage
   ** There is a lot of difference between javascript object and json object.
      js object does supports function and values are in single quotes, whereas
      json object does supports double quotes and wont work with functions.
   ** "Convert js object into Json" --->> JSON.stringify(js object) is used to convert the js object into json object.
   ** "Convert json into js object" --->> JSON.parse(json) is used to convert the json object into js object.
   ** localStorage is used to store the actions performed even after the page is refreshed.
   ** localStorage supports only strings.
   ** localStorage has methods such as .setItem() .getItem() .removeItem()
      .setItem(value1,value2) ---> is used to set the the value2 to value1.
      .getItem(value1) --->> to retreive the value[value2] stored in local storage we need to use value1 for it as retreival.
      .removeItem(value1) ---->> is used to remove the particular storage information from local storage. 
   ** When nothing exists in local storage, it gives us ''null''.
   ** Null means intentionally want something to be empty.
   ** Auto Boxing --->> It refers to the process of string to wrap in an object, it does not work with 
      null and undefined.
   **Objects for reference --->> In this place, if a object is created and the property and value is assigned
      such as const object1={
         name:'abhinay'
      }; -->> here the name abhinay is stored in computer memory whereas the object will store it reference to 
      locate it. Incase if an another object is pointed to the object1 then it wont create again in computer memory
      rather than it points to the object references from previous object.
   ** When we compare two objects it does compare the reference of it rather than the values present in it.
   ** Destructuring ---->> It is process of making a shortcut to the object property allocation to the variable
      such as:
               const message = object3.message; -->> the variable is assigned to the object property value.
               [Shortcut] const {message} = object4; -->> it means that object4 property message value is being
                  assinged to the variable message through the shortcut message.
               If it contains multiple properties then it is 
                  const {message, price} = object4;
   ** Shorthand method --->> Kind of method where in the js object we can direclty create the method rather than 
      using property for it.
   ** Built-In Objects provided by js are console,math,json,localStorage.

Document Object Model ----->>  It is a built-in object in precise a document object.

   ** It is certainly linked to the webpage, by using the objects with document Object
      changes can be made to the existing webpage such as
         eg:- document.title = 'Changed Title';
              document.body.innerHTML = 'Changed body';
   ** Dom is used to combine both js and html together.
   ** document.title is used to change the title of the html page.
   ** document.body is used for the changes in the body of the webpage or even to print the info in body.
   ** document.body.innerHTML is used to control the entire html inside the body.
   ** document.querySelector() is used to get any element from the page and put it inside javascript.
   ** You had choosen a button to retrieve using querySelector what if there are multiple buttons then how to retrieve it,
      here it goes by using the class attribute in the button
      eg:- <button class="js-button">Second Button</button>
            document.querySelector('.js-button');
   ** From the above . represents the class selector even in css to style a specific thing we use . and make sure after
      dot begin with js as it will easy to identify that it belongs to js.
   ** Objects are values and can be saved in a variable.
   ** Untill now we had learnt regarding the class attribute and their retrieval method but now
      what if we have an input to be entered and there is no innerHTML to be used then we shall retrieve the value through
      ".value"
      eg:- const amount = document.querySelector('.js-cost');
            console.log(amount.value);
   ** Type Coercion =   Whenever we get a value from dom like above it is a string, even though it is a 
      number but the type of it is a string.
      But In order to convert a string into number js has a built in function called as "Number()" similar to type casting.
   ** Onkeydown is an attribute which is used to display the text in console when we does hit the keys on the keyboard.
   ** clicks, keydowns are ====>> events
   ** onclick, onkeydown ======>> event listeners
   ** event is recognised as an object in js.
   ** Every event listener gets an event object.
   ** Window object is a built in object used to represent the entire browser and by default js adds this object before 
      other built in objects.
      eg:- window.console.log("hi"); is similar to console.log("hi");
   ** Onkeydown is used to get the text in the input field to be retreived 
      "After the key is pressed".
   ** OnkeyUp is used to get the text in the input field to be retreived
      "During the keys are pressed itself"

Arrays ------>> It is an another type of value that represents a list of values.

   ** It is a special type of object in javascript.
   ** In order to check whether an array is an array or not we can do using, Array.isArray();
   ** Arrays have properties and methods.
   ** In an array, if you need to push an element to the end then use .push() method to perform.
   ** In an array, if you need to remove an element from it then use .splice(index,how many values from index) this method can perform
      remove operation.
   ** In Js there is a concept called as destructuring, where in if the variable name and the object property has same name then this concept is
      used.    eg:- const name = todoList.name;
      using destructuring const {name} = todoList;
   ** Arrays are references, if we copy an array as another array it just copies it as the reference. Array1 is copied into array2 it 
      doesnt copy array1 into array2 it just copies the references. Both the arrays point to a single array in memory.
   ** In order to avoid this behaviour, there is a scope of copying arrays using ".slice()" method which represents as two arrays in
      the memory.
         eg:- array1=[1,2,3];
               array2 = array1.slice();
   ** In loops, there are two statements called as break, continue
      break is used to break the flow of loop.
      continue is used to skip one iteration and then continue the loop.
   ** While using break and continue in while loop, the increment statement has to be used in continue usage block otherwise it may result 
      to infinite loop.

Advance Functions ------->> Functions are like values.

   ** We can save a function inside a variable.
      eg:- const variable = function greet(){
         console.log('Morning');
      }
      variable();
   ** From above we can even remove the function name and keep it like this,
      eg:- const variable = function(){
         console.log('Morning);
      }
      variable();  -->> here the function is called as anonymous function.
   ** The two main advantages of using a normal function rather than above is that,
      1. Easier to read the function.
      2. Hoisting
   ** Hoisting is the process of calling the function before itself and later the function is declared.
      eg:- hello();
            function hello(){
               console.log('hello world!');
            }
   ** We can even put a function inside the object to such as,
      eg:- const object1={
               num:3,
               fun:function(){
                  console.log('animals eat food');
               }
            }
            object1.fun();
   ** setTimeout() --->> It is used to run a function in future.
      It does consists of two parameters setTimeout(function,milliseconds);
      setTimeout(function(){
         console.log('automate function in future')
      },5000);
   ** Asynchronous code is a type of code that does executes the statement ahead even though it has a function
      that takes some time to complete and then perform.
         -->> There is a function which is set to run in 5 seconds, meanwhile there is a 
               console statement below it.
                  -->> First the console statement is printed and then the timer function is runned, due to the 
                        Asynchronous code ability
         eg:- setTimeout(function(){
                  console.log('Asynchronous test');
               },5000);

               console.log('after Asynchronous');
   ** Synchronous code is a type of flow through which each statement is executed and then proceeds to the next one.
      eg:- console.log('one');
           console.log('two');
      first one is executed and then two is done in Synchronous manner.
   ** Synchronous code does the process one after the other.
   ** Asynchronous code does the process where one runs in background still the next one is executed and then the backgorund one is displayed.
   ** setInterval() is also a built in function where in it runs the function again and again for its scheduled time.
         eg:- setInterval(function(){
            console.log('set interval run');
         },5000);
   ** In order to stop the interval, we have function called clearInterval(intervalId); For every setInterval id it genereates a unique id 
      by using it we can stop the interval.
   ** Another way to loop through the array is using .forEach() method.
   ** If we need to use the continue statement in the foreach loop then instead of continue keyword, use need to use 
      return keyword in foreach loop as it performs the continue operation in foreach loop.
   ** If we need to use break then we can go for the normal for loop itself rather than foreach loop.
   ** Arrow Functions are the shorthand and easiest way to perform the function handling.
      eg:- const func = (param1) => {
         console.log("arrow functions");
         console.log(param1);
      }
      func();
   ** addEventListener(param1,param2) where in it is used to replace the onclick attribute and perform those operations by this
      in javascript itself. param1 should be a string with the event to be performed such as onClick is a eventListener but click is a event.
      so click should be param1 and then the function to perform over there.
   ** .removeEventListener(param1,param2) used to remove the event on the click of that button the parameters are same as the 
      addEventListener itself.
   ** By using the .addEventListener() and then using the keydown process in js used to make it clear enough.
         eg:- document.body.addEventListener('keydown',(event)=>{
                  console.log(event.key);
            })
   ** document.querySelectorAll() is used to give all the elements on the page.
   ** .filter() is a kind of foreach method which is used to perform the filter operations through the boolean values,
         if it is true then it creates another array and stores the values in it
         if it is false then it does not create another array at all.
         eg:- [1,-2,3].filter((value,index)=>{
            if(value>=0) return true;
            else return false;
         });
   ** .map() is used to perform the array values to be doubled or into transformative operation then it is used.
         eg:- [1,2,3].map((value,index)=>{
            return value*2;
         });
   ** Closure ----> if a function has access to the value, then it will always have access to that value.

   ** In order to get the decimal values upto the respective places then use .toFixed(<number>), here the number provides the 
         number provides the number of decimal places.
   ** If there are multiple js scripts then try to arrange the src file in a required manner
         to be applicable on the webpage.
   ** We can even add a class to the elements in javascript by using ----> .classList.add(<class-name>)
         and can be styled in css by using it.

Modules -------------->> A better way to organize the entire code.

   ** In order to use this module you need to remove the file name from the script element and then   
         use type="module' which enables the module funcitonality.
   ** Now whatever we need from one js file can be done using export and the info.
         eg:- export const cart=[];
   ** Now inorder to use that exported information we need to use the import one in that file.
         eg:- import {<element>} from '<file - path from whih export is present>'

External Libraries --------------->> Here you can get the code from external sources in the form of functions and then call them in your code.

   ** Here by using dayjs(); we can get the current date and time.
   ** In order to add additional timeline then use .add() function with two parameters in it,
         .add(<number of days>,<'type of timeline'>);
   ** In order to perform the date in a easy readable format then use 
      .format('dddd, MMMM D');
   ** ESM Version is a kind of version which is a ecmascript module,
      ecmascript is another one for javascript.
   ** There are two kinds of export:-
      --> Named Export = {<export functions>}
      --> Default export = <export function>
   ** Minification : - It is the process of combining the code for a future purpose in scripting.
   ** MVC - Model-View-Controller is basically used for updated the code and regenerating the html again and again.
         --> Model = Saves and manages the data
         --> View = takes the data and displays on the page.
         --> Controller = Runs some code to interact with the page.

Testing --------------------------->> A group of tests combined together is known as Test-Suite.
   
   ** Jasmine is one of the testing framework used for JS.
   ** Jest is one of the testing framework used for ReactJS.
   ** Spec is referred to test in Jasmine Testing Environment.
   ** In Jasmine, to create a test suite we use describe('<test suite: name>')
   ** In order to create the a test we use it(<name_of_test>,()=>{});
   ** In order to create an if statement and print it, in Jasmine we use 
      expect(<condition>).toEqual('20.95');
   ** Mocks are used to create fake version in order to overcome the localStorage issue.
         eg:- spyOn().and.callFake();
   ** Unit Testing, test a piece of code.
   ** Integration Testing, testing many units of code working together.
   ** Hooks - Let us run some code to test the code.
         beforeEach() = runs code before each test
         afterEach() = runs code after each test
         beforeAll() = runs code before all tests
         afterAll() = runs code after all tests

Object Oriented Programming ---------------------->> Treating everything in the format of objects and classes.

   ** this keyword is used to provide the access to the outside object and let an object access its own properties.
   ** In order to provide the private access modifier to the variables or methods use # infront of it.
   ** Inheritance - let us reuse the code between classes.
   ** super() is used to call the constructor of the parent class.
   ** Discriminator Property - It tells us which type of class it is.
         eg:- type:'clothing'
   ** Polymorphism - use a method without knowing the class.
   ** Built In Class - Classes provided by the language.
         eg:- const date = new Date();
              date.toLocaleTimeString();
   ** this becomes undefined inside a regular function.
   ** Inside a method of the object, this points to the outer object.
   ** Inside a method, this is undefined but can be change during the method call by using   
         <function_name>.call('<text>');
   ** Arrow functions do not change the value of this rather present the value present outer of it.

Backend -----------------------> Another Computer that manageas the data of a website.

   ** In order to send a HTTP request to the Backend, we have a built in class as XMLHttpRequest
   ** Url Path - the url path is provided such that, https://supersimplebackend.dev/hello' here /hello is the url path.
   ** Status code starting with 4 is our problem.
   ** Status code starting with 5 is backend problem.
   ** Status code starting with 2 is success.
   ** Call Back ----> a function to run in the future.
   ** Promises ------> better way to handle asynchronous code.
         resolve() it is used to perform the next set of steps to be executed.
   ** Drawback of call back --> It creates a lot of nested functions internally.
   ** Advantage of Promise --> It is used to flatten the code.
   ** In order to run all the promises at a time then, we use  
         Promise.all([<list of promises]).then();
   ** Fetch ---> Is a better way to make HTTP Requests.
   ** Async Wait ----> even better way to handle asynchronous code.
   ** It makes a function return a promise.
   ** Await ---> Let us wait for a promise to finish, before going to the next line.
         It let us write asynchronous code like normal code.
   ** Await can be used only inside the async function.

Error Handling -------------------------------> To Capture the errors

   ** In Call Back, addEventListener and then first parameter is error and the other are
         the function of it.
   ** In promise there is catch() function with a console statement.
   ** In async wait there can be used with the help of an try catch block.
   ** Try/catch can be used only for unexpected errors but not for all.
   ** In promise if you want create an error in future then use, reject();
         it can be used in the resolve parameter area itself.


Retreiving the Summary Page after Orders ------------> The Final Page

   ** .unshift() is used to add the data to the first of the array.
