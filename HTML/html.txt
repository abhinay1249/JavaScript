** A tag which doesnt have a closing tag are known as void element.
    eg:- <img>,<link>
** A <div> tag is like a container which is used to contain other elements like buttons, paragraphs tags etc.
** In html, we cannot have a paragraph inside a paragraph. So we use div tag for it to perform.
** A paragraph tag does have extra space above and below, whereas a div tag does not provide it.
** A data attribute is a kind of another HTML attribute which allows us to attach any information to an element.
    syntax:- need to start with data-<any name>
** .dataset is used to give all the data from the "data-" attribute property.
